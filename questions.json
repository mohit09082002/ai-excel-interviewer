    "question": "What is the difference between relative, absolute, and mixed cell references in Excel? Please provide a simple example of each.",
    "expected_concepts": "A correct answer must define all three. Relative reference (e.g., A1) changes when a formula is copied. Absolute reference (e.g., $A$1) remains constant no matter where the formula is copied. Mixed reference (e.g., $A1 or A$1) has one part absolute and one part relative. A good example is using them to create a multiplication table."

    "question": "Imagine you need to create a dependent dropdown list. If a user selects a 'Region' (e.g., 'North') in cell A1, you want cell B1 to show a dropdown of only the cities in that region. How would you achieve this?",
    "expected_concepts": "This requires a combination of Named Ranges and the `INDIRECT` function within Data Validation. The process is: 1. Create separate lists of cities for each region. 2. Name each list according to its region (e.g., a list of northern cities is named 'North'). 3. Select cell B1, go to Data Validation, choose 'List' for 'Allow', and enter the formula `=INDIRECT(A1)` as the source."

    "question": "You have a dataset with 'Product', 'Month', and 'Sales'. You need to find the sales amount for a specific product in a specific month. Without using `XLOOKUP`, `SUMIFS`, or `FILTER`, how can you perform this two-criteria lookup using an array formula?",
    "expected_concepts": "The classic solution is an array formula using `INDEX` and `MATCH`. The key is to perform a multi-criteria match by concatenating the lookup values and the lookup arrays within the `MATCH` function. The formula would look like: `=INDEX(sales_range, MATCH(product_value & month_value, product_range & month_range, 0))`. The candidate must mention that this needs to be entered with Ctrl+Shift+Enter in older Excel versions."

    "question": "You receive a 'cross-tab' report where years are column headers (e.g., 2022, 2023, 2024) and products are row labels. This format is not suitable for a PivotTable. How would you use Power Query to transform this into a 'normalized' table with three columns: 'Product', 'Year', and 'Sales'?",
    "expected_concepts": "The candidate must describe the 'Unpivot' operation in Power Query. The steps are: 1. Load the data into the Power Query Editor. 2. Select the column(s) that should remain fixed (in this case, the 'Product' column). 3. Right-click the selected column's header and choose 'Unpivot Other Columns'. This transforms all other columns into an attribute-value pair, which can then be renamed to 'Year' and 'Sales'."
